# Strava Scrape

Currently using Chromedriver for Chrome Version 102. Downgrade if necessary.


Include a user Interface. A Strava account is required; although premium isn't necessary, the user you wish to scrape must have a public profile.


Login, set cookie and it will login automatically upon each session. If you wish to reset the cookie, just delete 'cookies.json' in the main program folder.
